# Computer Architecture Projects

#### To understand how processors worked, we were asked to build an assembler to convert assembly code to machine code and a similator that would convert machine code into assembly code. To understand how caches worked, we were asked to build a cache simulator that would take maachine code and the cache, including the size, accociativity, blocksize and number of row, and would output the correctly formatted cache configuration.
